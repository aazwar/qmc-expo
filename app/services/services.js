*Fraxel Resurfacing*
 
Fraxel skin treatment is the latest form of laser skin rejuvenation that promises the dramatic results of ablative treatments without the serious side effects of traditional skin resurfacing. It's just one of the latest nonsurgical cosmetic options now available, which continue to grow in popularity. Last year similar noninvasiveprocedures increased by more than 50 percent. The Fraxel laser involves resurfacing only 1720 percent of the skin's surface at a time so there's no major redness or recovery time needed. Fraxel's edge is that it is more gentle to the skin. It can produce dramatic improvements to aging and sun damaged skin. The results include elimination of unwanted pigment and blemishes, improvement in texture, Thne lines as well as deep lines, scars and stretch marks. It is unlike anything else on the market. Instead of removing the entire outer layer of skin, as in previous methods, the Fraxel beam is split up and heats microscopic columns of tissue (leaving healthy tissuein between). It basically creates a grid of small wounds on the skin (invisible to the naked eye). After three to three treatments from 1 – 4 weeks apart, the results are similar to traditional ablative resurfacing. The typical Fraxel patient has wrinkles, brown spots, wrinkles and redness. Unlike aggressive laser resurfacing which can be used only on the face, Fraxel can be used anywhere on the body -- back, neck, upper chest and hands. It also has excellent effects on acne scarring and is one of the only effective treatments for stretch marks. The treatment itself takes about 20 minutes, with about 40 minutes needed for a local anaesthetic to numb the skin. The sensation during treatment is of a pricking sensation on the face, and feeling of a sunburn for approximately 1 – 2 hours after the session. Recovery is immediate, with any redness subsiding shortly after the treatment. There can be a period of skin peeling similar to that of a sunburn. Fraxel treatments should only be given by a board certiThed plastic surgeon or dermatologist with special training in fractional laser resurfacing. Results can be dramatic, but it is important to ensure that the machine settings are appropriate and safe, to have the beneTht of no side effects and yet have effective treatment sessions

*Smart Xide: “Dot Therapy”*
 
_Fractional CO₂ Resurfacing_
In the past 1012 years, we have seen the emergence of many laser technologies promising much but delivering fair to sometimes good results. The emergence of FDA-approved fractional Co2 resurfacing is a breath of fresh air in an already crowded market. Fractional CO₂ resurfacing is a major advance in the Thght against aging skin (wrinkles), pigmentation problems, acne and loose skin — giving the recipient a “refreshed” look without the down time of traditional
_CO₂ resurfacing_
CO₂ laser light heats and removes the topmost layers of skin. With the “fractional” technology, some skin is spared (small dots) to allow for faster healing without the original down time of conventional Co2 lasers (the gold standard for wrinkle reduction). The trade-off is that multiple treatments may be needed based on the fraction of healed skin left behind. This procedure is based on patient preference. The skin is left baby-soft with decreased lines above the lips, crows’ feet, cheeks, neck, and chest. With experience, the lower lids and upper lids may also be tightened without surgery. Large pores, melasma, and poor skin tone can all be tightened with now minimal down time (three to four days, also known as a “weekend lift”). Patients have had the procedure on Friday and been back to work Monday with makeup and no problems.
 
*PRP INJECTIONS FOR HAIR LOSS*
 
PRP has been proven in the past to assist and speed up soft tissue healing from sports injury as well as wounds, ulcers or burns. It is believe that the use of PRP may be beneThcial for hair transplant graft survival as well as possibly waking up dormant or inactive hair follicle cells which can assist in prevention and even stimulation of hair growth in both male and female patients suffering from hair loss. The process is similar for facial injection of PRP and the injection or dermaroller is used on the scalp only in the thinning or balding areas. PRP is also used in combination with oral medication, topical creams or serums, mesotherapy and Low Level Laser Hair growth therapy for a combined effect to maximize results.
 
*IV GLUTATHIONE FOR SKIN BRIGHTENING AND REJUVENATION*
 
For patients who want more extreme skin lightening and brightening we offer IV drip of an anti oxidant known as Glutathione. We have developed the Skin Brightening IV, which includes glutathione, vitamin C and other vitamins/minerals. Not only is this treatment effective for most people, it is also safe. The Skin Brightening IV glutathione is a good alternative to skin bleaching creams, which can damage, scar, inflame, discolour . This safe and natural treatment involves principally the use of intravenous (IV) vitamins including glutathione. Our Intravenous Glutathione Skin Whitening Treatment can lighten your skin evenly. Glutathione is administered via IV and is able to deposit evenly throughout the body. Glutathione will help remove the oxidative damaged cells (which cause skin to darken) and lighten your skin naturally, safely, evenly and in a healthy manner.
Scar Improvement
Acne Treatment
- Active acne
- Acne scarring
- Medical treatment of acne
 
*HIFU (HIGH INTENSITY FOCUSED ULTRASOUND)*
 
HIFU is a medical procedure that applies high focused ultrasound energy to locally heat an area that will result with lifting and tightening of the skin. It is considered the GOLD standard for skin tightening. It is a non invasive procedure, it is used on both the upper and lower face as well as jawline and neck.
- Reducing Thne lines and wrinkles
Skin lifting and tightening
- Eyebrow and forehead lifting
- Neck and jawline deThnition
- Delaying and slowing the process of aging to the area treated
Unlike lasers that penetrate from the outside, HIFU by passes the skin and delivers targeted energy to the area the doctor wants to treat. It penetrates to the deep layers and structural tissues and muscles to stimulate tightening and collagen formation. Some result is evident immediately with gradual improvement over the next few months. The procedure takes approximately 15 minutes, and patients sit for approximately 45 minutes before with topical anaesthetic cream. The procdure itself is virtually painless there is just some mild pressure from the handpiece and some warm feeling to the face or neck. There is no down time – mild swelling or redness will disappear almost immediately and patients can return to work immediately. The results can last over a year however skin continues to age and it is recommended to repeat the HIFU session yearly to maintain and prevent progression.
 
*THREAD LIFT*
 
The thread Lift is a procedure which involves elevating different parts of the face using special threads without having to make surgical incisions as with a classic face lift. Thread Lift may be marketed under a variety of names including, APTOS®Thread Lift, Contour Lift, Silk Lift™, Feather Lift™ or Happy Lift. There are two main types of threads or sutures used: Free Coating cogged or barbed threads which do not need to be suspended in order to hold the lift; and smooth or suspension threads which need to be anchored to a stable structure of the face or scalp. This procedure is best suited to patients with mild to moderate sagging of facial tissues, usually those in their mid-thirties to Thfties. Thread Lift is usually performed using a local anaesthetic. Recovery is generally quick. The plastic surgeon or dermatologist can assess if you would be a good candidate for threadlift. Results are not as drastic as a surgical facelift and results do not last as long as traditional facelift. However for younger patients who want a slight improvement and lifting effect it is a good option.
 
*LASER VAGINAL REJUVENATION (LVR)*
 
Vaginal relaxation refers to the stretching of the pelvic floor supports (connective tissue, ligaments and muscles) that takes place as a result of time, aging, childbirth, genetics, lifestyle etc). Pregnancy and more importantly labour and vaginal delivery are the factors most often associated with the loss of sensation and damage to the female pelvic floor. It not only results in changes in sensation during intercourse but may have an adverse impact on urinary and lower bowel function (urinary incontinence and problems with emptying the bowels).

Many women suffer from their symptoms for many years before seeking help because the symptoms are often embarrassing and because there is a lack of information. Now, there is a non surgical approach to tighten the vagina after childbirth to help improve all aspects of the female anatomy. Laser vaginal rejuvenation is
• a non-surgical, no downtime solution to the symptoms related to vaginal atrophy or softening
• a solution for mild and moderate stress and mixed incontinence
• photo thermal tightening of urethral and anterior bladder wall region
• incision less, minimally invasive treatment for vaginal problems
• no anesthesia needed
• walk-in/walk-out procedure
• safe, quick and easy
• high success rate and patient satisfaction
The procedure itself takes only about 15 minutes and there is no need for anaesthetic as the procedure is pain free. Approximately three sessions are recommended but many patients are satisThed with one or two sessions as well. With the laser, you are only required to abstain from sexual intercourse for 2448 hours. Daily activities can be resumed immediately after Thnishing the treatment, without any feeling of discomfort, or any need for medications.
 
*MOLE ASSESSMENT AND REMOVAL*
 
More than 1 in 3 melanoma skin cancers appear in those under age 55 and it is the second most common cancer in those aged 1534. If a mole changes its appearance, or if a new mark appears on the skin that looks like a mole, this may represent malignant melanoma and should be reported to your doctor for urgent mole assessment. The surgical removal of malignant melanoma at an early stage in its development can prevent its spread and cure the condition.

Almost everyone has moles and some people have quite a lot. It can be difficult to know whether a mole has changed or whether a mark on your skin is new. This is a particular problem for skin sites that are hard to keep an eye on, for instance your back. Our experienced dermatologists can examine and assess your moles. We can also provide a state of the art computer-assisted mole mapping and digital photo-dermoscopy surveillance service. This is particularly useful for people who are known to have an increased risk of the development of malignant melanoma. Moles that have no risk of developing cancer can also be removed for cosmetic reasons. Moles can be removed by either our state of the art CO2 laser or by a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in minutes. Visit our dermatologists today to explain to you which option is best for you.
 
*PIERCING*
 
Umbilical or “belly button” piercing has become as common as ear piercing, however, due to the risk of infection and increased risk of bleeding it is recommended to be performed by a licensed doctor. The procedure involves a tiny injection of local anesthetic so that you will not feel any discomfort. The piercing takes a few seconds and the stud which must be titanium or stainless steel must stay in place 6 weeks. Cleansing and rotation of the stud will be explained by the doctor performing the piercing. We have male and female doctors available for this procedure.
 
*DIMPLE CREATION*
 
A natural dimple is usually formed when there is a small defect in the cheek musculature (most often the buccinator muscle). The skin overlying this small defect is stuck down to the underlying connective tissue and creates a dimple in the skin with facial animation (smiling). Dimple creation surgery can simulate this naturally occurring process. To create a dimple, a small painless incision is made in the inside of your cheek. There is no incision or scar on the outside skin. A small absorbable suture is passed through the inside of the cheek and catches the undersurface of the skin where the dimple is desired. When this suture is tied it causes a dimpling in the overlying skin. At Thrst there is a dimple present even without smiling, but after several days, or sometimes a few weeks, the dimple is only present while smiling or moving the face. The scarring between the inner skin and muscle will cause a permanent dimple even after the suture is absorbed. Dimple creation surgery can be done on any type or size cheek, although some cheeks are probably better candidates than others. You can decide where the dimples will be, or you can have the doctor decide with you where the most optimal place for the dimples should be on your face. Dimple creation surgery can be done in our center with nothing more than local anesthesia. You will be awake and comfortable during the entire dimple surgery process. The dimple surgery takes about 20 minutes to perform and you can go home right away after the procedure.`,

    name: `Hair Transplantation`,
    desc: `*HAIR LOSS PHENOMENON:*
 
Hair loss and baldness can have a devastating effect on a person’s appearance, confidence and self-esteem. Hair loss effects hundreds of people every year and no lotion or pill has become an effective treatment or cure for baldness. In the US alone, patients spend up to $200 million per year on worthless solutions for hair loss that are unproven, ineffective and of no benefit.

Hair transplantation is the only natural way to bring back living, growing hair to areas of thinning and balding. Today’s refined technique of hair restoration allows for extremely natural appearing hairlines that are artistically evaluated and created according to the shape of your face and pattern of hair loss. Results turn sparse, thinning areas into a fuller, thicker appearing head of natural hair.

Our technique of implanting “micro” and “mini” hair grass archives fullness and density allowing for maximum coverage of balding or thinning areas. Result are permanent, and should last your entire lifetime.
 
*THE ART AND SCIENCE OF HAIR RESTORATION*
 
Our technique of hair transplantation is based on the fact that an individual’s “donor” area consists of genetically programmed hairs resistant to the thinning effects and causes of hair loss. This horseshoe region at the back of the head contains hairs that can be transplanted to areas of thinning and baldness maintaining their resistance to hair loss. Virtually all of the hairs transplanted will continue to grow for the client’s lifetime. Recreation of natural hairlines is virtually indistinguishable from original.
 
*THE CONSULTATION:*
 
All of our plastic surgeons and dermatologists performing the hair transplant procedure have specialized training in the FUE or follicular unit extraction technique. In the initial consultation, the surgeon will speak with you directly to explain. The doctor will discuss your medical and surgical options after completing a detailed history and assessing your hair loss pattern. A plan will be developed that may include current hair loss medications or treatments, surgery or a combination of both.

The consultation is a very important step in the process of hair transplantation. The doctor will check the density of your donor and recipient site as well diagram the potential recreation of your hairline. Discussion of the procedure will be done at this time and our clients are encouraged to ask any questions they may have. Our coordinator can also help you with any questions you may have.
 
*THE TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE:*
 
All procedures take place using local anesthetic. This allows for maximum effciency, comfort and ease of treatment during the procedure. As previously mentioned, the procedure is only performed by surgeons specially trained in hair transplantation using the FUE technique. Registered nurses assist in preparing and monitoring the patient during the procedure as well our specialized hair
technicians prepare the grafts for implantation under microscopic view.

Generally the procedure involves the following steps:
1. The area to be transplanted is prepared initially by shaving or cutting short the donor area. Depending on the donor site density and numbers of hairs to be transplanted, this area may be small or may require shaving the full head. Hair in the donor area can be trimmed to 2 mm in length. Hair grows back quickly and the area is covered within a few days.

2. Oral medications for pain and to Medication to decrease any swelling is given before the procedure, as well your blood pressure will be checked.

3. The donor area is anaesthetized first using a very small microscopic needle. This allows for excellent pain control and it works almost immediately.

4. After the anesthetic has taken effect, the procedure of removing the follicular units is started. The follicular units (FU) contain individual hairs and combination of hairs (24) per unit. This allows for the formation of a verynatural hair line, using single hairs and allowing for a gradual increase in density to the back of the head as in thegrowth of hair. During this part of the procedure you will be lying face down. You will have no pain as theanesthetic is regularly given, and many patients sleep during this extraction phase. Depending on the number ofhairs, this part may last a few hours. You will be given many breaks to eat or drink or stretch your legs.

5. During extraction, the hair technician will clean and prepare the hairs for implantation.

6. The recipient or balding area will then be prepared after the extraction of the hair is complete. You will then belying on your back for the implantation which occurs much faster as the doctor is assisted by 23 hair techniciansto speed the process. Individual hairs are inserted by the transplant team to allow for an efficient and coordinatedprocedure maximizing the number of grafts inserted.

7. The grafts are held in place by coagulated blood and fibrin and no stitches are required. After the implantation you will be told to return to the clinic the following day to check the grafts and follow up with the surgeon.

8. Specific washing and care instructions will be given to you by the surgeon. These are very simple to follow butextremely important to allow for successful growth of the grafts. You will also be given prescription for somemedications you will be taking for the next few days.

9. Depenfing on the number of hairs you will transplant the procedure takes from 48 hours you can return to work the following day and resume normal activity shortly after.

*NUMBER OF HAIR TRANSPLANT PROCEDURES NEEDED:*
Depending on the number of follicular units used, generally the front third to half of a completely bald head canbe treated in 12 sessions. Many patients are satisfied with the coverage and fullness of one session. Depending onthe extent of your hair loss, the surgeon will explain to you if you may need further hair transplants in the future.Transplant sessions can easily be repe ated if your hair loss progresses, as with FUE the hair donor site is leftintact, with no scar or incision.
 
*FINAL RESULTS:*
 
It is impossible to predict precisely how many hairs will appear in any graft, but at least 90% will normally survivetransplantation. The final appearance and full growth will not be evident for 812 months due to the hair growthcycle of the hair follicle. The transplanted areas should last into approximately the 7th decade of your life. Withsome natural thinning occurring over time. With the latest techniques of follicular unit grafting the hairline has anatural appearance and allows for increased density at the balding or thinning area

It is important to have realistic expectations. One session will not give you the density you had as a teenager,however increased density in thin or balding areas will allow for a natural hair transplant that will lookundetectable to your family and friend. It will help you hold onto the hair density that you have for a much longer medication will also assist in maintaining your hair for a much longer time.Your hair transplant surgeon will give you an artist ically developed hair line that will last for many years tocome.`,

    desc: `Our hydration therapy utilizes a common, minimally-invasive procedure to intravenously deliver fluids, medications, vitamins, and other nutritional supplements directly into your bloodstream to provide relief for a multitude of common ailments associated with the accumulative effects of dehydration. Administered by experienced, board-certified physicians and registered nurses, our therapies are safe and highly effective. Your overall health is reflected in your skin. If you are healthy from the inside, it will show in your skin. Our anti aging and skin cleansing IV program can help alleviate and prevent some of the problems that can lead to the aging appearance of the skin.

Good hydration is essential to the promotion of healthy skin and prevention of wrinkles and aging. Our skin loses its elasticity and fine wrinkles form around the eyes and mouth. Skin may become dry, wrinkled and thin. The accumulation of toxins in the body can lead to premature aging by stimulating the formation of free radicals that can cause cell and tissue damage. IV antioxidants fight these free radicals that affect your skins elasticity. IV antioxidants and hydration combination effects can improve your skin and slow down the aging process.

Hydration is essential in maintaining your health and appearance. Direct delivery of hydration by IV means that your body absorbs 100% of their benefits – drinking fluids or energy drinks your body absorbs only 55%. IV therapy infusion allows complete absorption into the blood stream and immediate effect of any added vitamins and minerals. The solution does not have "first pass" through liver – thus reducing load on liver and bypassing digestion so nutrients get into the cells as needed and increase cell metabolism.
IV creates tissue saturation which is the ability to get the nutrients and fluids where you want them, directly into the circulation where they can reach body tissues at high doses without loss. In order to achieve a more youthful appearance, deep tissue saturation of nutrients in required. Oral treatments fail to be absorbed at the same level.

Every single vitamin and mineral is important and is required by the body. Although most food products contain these, it is still quite difficult to get the recommended dose for the day. Oral tablets are easy to forget and if you do take them daily a high percentage of their effectiveness is lost in the digestive system. With IV therapy the vitamins or mineral concentrate are mixed in saline solution and then injected directly into your veins. This will ensure that these nutrients will be absorbed by the body faster and more efficiently. The IV infusion includes normal saline which is needed in our body. It assists with hydration of the body and skin. Dehydration damages your skin and body organs.

Even just 2% dehydration can do this harm to our body. Dehydration and its aging effects on the skin and body cannot be reversed using creams or lotions. Hydration must come from inside. If you are unable to maintain an adequate amount of fluids or would like to simply increase your hydration levels leading to improved skin tone and energy levels, IV hydration is an easy solution. Your treatment is designed and directly supervised by our highly skilled physician. A medical history will be taken and bloodwork ordered to assess which IV cocktail will benefit you most. If booster shots are necessary to increase specific levels of vitamins you are lacking these are also available. Our doctor will follow your progress and ensure that you are getting the best combination of treatments. Our IV treatments are administered quickly and you begin to feel the effects immediately. Results last for days and on maintenance programs you will maintain optimal vitamin and hydration levels to help you keep energized and looking well.

*Cellactor*
 
Skin elasticity decreases with age. The typical ‘orange peel’ appearance on thighs, buttocks and upper arms affects 80% of all women. the latest and most effective technology today is known as Acoustic Wave fierapy (»AWT™«). AWT uses high-energy acoustic waves that are generated by means of two combinable therapy devices – planar and radial type applicators. Aesthetic and dermatological disorders such as cellulite, scars, edema (swelling) and stretch marks can be treated effectively and with long-lasting results. It can reverse or eliminate the visible signs of cellulite.
 
*Measurable dermatological success*

Cellulite typically appears on the arms, thighs and buttocks. The connective tissue is soft and elastic and exhibits a wide meshed network of collagen fibres. An imbalance between fat production (lipogenesis) and fat breakdown (lipolysis) within the cells leads to formation of large fat cells that bulge outward giving the typical dimpled appearance (orange peel skin). The therapy success of the »AWT™« method is evidenced by the formation of a collagenous-elastic fibre network in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. A significant improvement in skin elasticity lasting over 6 months has been documented in clinical examinations.
 
*What is AWT and why is it effective?*
 
Acoustic Wave Treatment uses acoustic sound waves that are introduced into the effected body regions. The results
are:
- Skin smoothing and rejuvenation
- Breakdown of fat deposits and drainage to lymphatic system
- Connective tissue tightening – Reduction of bulging fat
- Reduced circumference of affected body regions (slimming)
- Studies conducted in Switzerland, Germany and the US have shown a 110% improvement in skin elasticity.

*Treatment Procedure*
 
Contact gel is applied to the treatment region to ensure that the acoustic sound waves are introduced into the body without energy loss. Treatment is pain free. The applicators are gently moved in a systematic manner over the treatment area.
 
*Treatment Duration and Frequency*
 
Each cellulite treatment session takes about 30 minutes. Depending on the degree of cellulite, 6 - 10 sessions at 4 – 7 day intervals may be necessary.
 
*Recommended Accompanying Measures*
 
AWT results are enhanced with physical exercise and a low fat diet. 2 -3 litres of liquid per day are required to ensure rapid elimination of waste products.`,

*FAT TRANSFER TO BUTTOCK REGION “BRAZILIAN BUTTOCK LIFT”*
Women who want to improve the shape or size of their buttock area can have a procedure in which fat is removed from one area of the body such as stomach or hips and transferred to another area such as buttocks to contour the shape. Thfie procedure is done usually on an outpatient basis, but some patients do like to stay over one night in the hospital. Thfie surgeon will advise you which areas are acceptable for liposuction to remove an adequate amount of fat, and the surgeon will decide with you during the consultation which areas you would want enhanced and which will give the most attractive and natural looking result. Once you decide to do the surgery blood work would be taken and pre op photos will be done for your ftle so that you can compare the before and afffter. Thfie liposuction can take 12 hours depending on the number of areas and amount of fat required. Once the fat is removed it is sterilized and prepared for reinjection using a small cannula or tube. The total amount for the surgery can be approximately 34 hours.
 
Recovery difiers for every patient. Some recover rapidly and within 12 days are back to fairly normal activity. Other patients take longer. We encourage patients to walk an move about shortly affer the procedure and pain meds are given on a regular basis to assist with recovery. Patients must wear a tight compression garment for approximately 4 weeks affer the surgery. fiis garment helps with reducing swelling and tightening the skin.

Patients must have someone that can bring them home affer the surgery. Follow up appointments will be given by our nursing stafi as well as any prescriptions needed.
 
*LIPOSUCTION*
 
_What is liposuction?_
Liposuction surgery is performed to actually remove unwanted localized deposits of fat cells from the body. The procedure is meant for body contouring, not a treatment for obesity. A suction tube is inserted through a tiny incision placed in an inconspicuous location on the skin. With a high pressure vacuum, fat cells are extracted through the tube. The result is a sculpting of bulging areas into more attractive contours.

_Who are the best candidates?_
- Have ftrm, elastic skin and are in good health
- Have tried to eliminate bulges through diet and exercise
- Have distinct areas of localized fat that are disproportionate to the rest of their body
- Have realistic expectations, and are only slightly or moderately overweight

_How will my skin look like?_
Stretch marks remain unchanged affer surgery. Your new ftgure will be similar to what you would expect if you could lose an equal amount of localized fat through diet and exercise alone. The use of smaller cannulas allows the ftbrous connections between your skin and body to remain. fiese connections will contract over time, giving the skin a ftrmer and tighter appearance. Liposuction will not get rid of cellulite, although many patients notice a general improvement in the appearance of the cellulite affer fat cells are removed.

_What will my recovery be like?_
You may go home the day of the procedure and rest for a couple of days. Affer this you may gradually increase your activity as tolerated aftffer 52 days you should resume normal activities, however, you will have to wear a snug elastic dressing , girdle or body stocking for 43 weeks afffter surgery.
 
_Which areas can be treated with liposuction?_
Thfie most frequent areas treated in men are fat deposits on the waist, breast reduction ( Gynecomastia ), abdomen and neck.
In Women, they include: thighs, buttocks, hips, stomach, knees, lower leg, cheeks and double chins. Some women elect to have their fat recycled to other areas of the body such as the cheeks or buttocks, this is known as “ fat transfer ”
 
_Is the fat removal permanent?_
 Yes! It seems that affer puberty we do not create new fat cells, when you gain weight you simply expand the fat cells that you already have. Liposuction permanently removes fat cells to improve your contour. Should you gain weight again, it will go to the fat cells that remain in your body. fiThe localized fatty deposits that existed prior to liposuction can no longer balloon up out proportion to the surrounding areas.
 
*ABDOMINOPLASTY (TUMMY TUCK) FULL + MINI*
 
A ‘tummy tuck’, or abdominoplasty is a surgical procedure designed to flatten a protruding abdomen by tightening the muscles in the abdominal wall and removing excess skin and fatty tissue. The procedure is a common one and can beneftt men and women alike. Patients whose weight loss has stabilized or are at their ideal weight are the best candidates for the procedures. Many patients combine their tummy tuck with other procedures such as liposuction.

_What will the procedure be like?_
Liposuction alone can produce a thin abdominal wall for some patients. Depending on your laxity and excess skin, a mini-tummy tuck can be done. A smaller incision is made in the bikini area with no incision around the navel. Patients with severe laxity of the abdominal muscle or excessive skin may require a full tummy tuck. fiis involves an incision around the belly button and a larger incision that runs from hip to hip. Thfie procedures will be explained in detail by your surgeon. fiThe surgery is performed in an outpatient basis, with a day stay in hospital. You may have surgical drains and sutures will be removed in 2 –1 weeks. A special abdominal support garment is necessary for several weeks. Scarring will fade signiftcantly over time. Results can be dramatic and patients love their slimmer ftgure and flatter abdomen. A protuberant abdomen can be a cause of distress for men and women alike. It can be the result of excess fat, weak abdominal muscles, pregnancy or loose skin that has been overstretched and no longer responds to diet and exercise. For those who have experienced a massive weight loss, their only alternative to loose hanging skin is surgery.
 
*Consultation*
 
During your private consultation with the surgeon, you should explain your goals & expectations of the surgery. Your abdomen is assessed and the procedure will be explained in detail. Any questions or concerns you may have can be addressed by the surgeon. You will be shown several before and affer treatment photos of patients with similar procedures. Photographs may be taken of your abdomen to document improvement.
 
*BREAST SURGERY*
 
_Thfie procedure_
Breast liftfts and augmentations are formed in an operative room setting using general or local anesthesia. Most patients stay 12 nights in the hospital. The procedure usually takes about 23 hours depending on the complexity. Details Of the surgery, appearance and location of the scars as well as the probable outcome of size of the breasts will be discussed preoperatively. Pre-operative consultation for breast augmentation will include which type of implant will be used and which size you would prefer. One of the more common techniques involves an incision under the lower portion of the breast near the chest wall, or under the lower portion of the nipple/areola. Affer the incision is made a pocket is created under tissue or muscle and implant is securely positioned in the pocket.
 
_What is recovery like?_

Most women experience mild bruising, swelling and discomfort for a few days. fiese symptoms will gradually subside and Dr.Quttainah will advise you on a proper schedule to return to normal activity .Most patients are back to work within the ftrest week.
 
_What is breast lift or mastopexy?_
When women age or have children, their breasts tend to lose fat and the breast tissue begins to thin. In most cases, when the breast tissue shrinks, the skin does not and areola and nipple begins to droop down. Breast lift allows for surgical lifting of the breast as well as lifting of the nipple to restore a more vibrant and youthful look to the breast.
 
_What is a breast augmentation?_
Breast enhancement or augmentation can dramatically improve the appearance of a women’s breasts. The procedure is done to enlarge small breasts. Underdeveloped breasts or breasts that have decreased in size affer a women has had children. Saline implants or silicone cohesive gel implants may be used silicone implant incisions may be slightly larger than saline, but they tend to feel more natural in selected patients.
 
_Can breast lift be combined with any other procedure?_
Yes many patients who request a breast lift also want to have the fullness back. fiese patients usually decide to have augmentation (implants) as well. In certain instances, the augmentation will aid in stretching the skin enabling Dr. Quttainah to do a breast lift with shorter scars. Other patients may require breast reduction as well as a breast lift to restore the look they desire.
 
*EYELID SURGERY*
 
Eyelid surgery or blepharoplasty can correct sagging eyelids, remove fatty pouches beneath the eyes and remove excess skin from the upper eyelids. Blepharoplasty can be done alone or in combination with other facial surgery procedures such as a facelift, browlift or laser skin resurfacing.

The surgeon places a ftne incision in the crease above each eye to correct problems of the upper eyelids. Thfien a thin crescent of excess skin and muscle is removed. The incision is closed with very ftne sutures. To remove the fatty deposits beneath the eyes, the incisions are placed just inside the lower eyelid. Affer the fat is removed, the incisions will be closed with absorbable sutures. When excess skin and muscle needs to be removed from the lower lids the incisions are placed in the natural smile crease below the lash line. fiThe procedure can take between one and two hours depending on the extent of the surgery.
 
_What about recovery?_

*TRICHOPIMENTATION*
 
STP Overview: Scalp Tricho Pigmentation… An Advanced Form of Scalp Micro Pigmentation (SMP) Scalp Tricho Pigmentation (STP) is a medical tattoo process that recreates an appearance of naturally growing hair for people who are balding or have thinning hair. The goal is to exactly replicate the appearance of shaved hair follicles or stubble of hair. It can be used to create a shaved look, thicken thinning hair, or camouflage scars. It can also be used to give the shadowing eftect for females with thinning hair to make hair appear more dense and cover exposed scalp. Thfie impressions are extremely discrete and are comparable in diameter to a single hair or follicular unit. It is a similar methodology to a regular tattoo or permanent cosmetics procedure, but, the pigment is not laid as deeply into the skin, and the machine and pigments themselves are far more sophisticated.
fiThere are currently 3 main ways that SMP can be used:
1. To create a shaved look that mimics the look of shaved or closely cropped head of hair with the appearance of stubble.
2. To camouflage scars from either Strip or FUE surgery
3. To “thicken” or increase the illusion of density in areas of thinning hair by decreasing the color contrast between scalp and hair. fiis is similar to the eftect of cosmetic concealers like Toppix but with the advantage not having to be applied daily. fiis can be particularly useful in women. It can also be useful. It can also be very beneficial for patients who have undergone previous surgeries, but who are still looking thinner than they would.
 
Scalp micropigmenation is a temporary procedure that needs to be repeated once every year. If your hair continues to thin and there is complete loss of hair, the tattoo will fade accordingly. The pigmentation can be done before or aer hair transplant as well to increase density eftffect.

Using pigment to simulate hair requires very specialized needles and ink formulations. fiis process cannot be done through the use of regular tattoo practices. Common tattoo needles are too round. And using this to apply ink would create very large, obvious looking dots. Typical Scalp Micropigmentation treatments not only use specially shaped needles to create realistic looking hair cross sections, but also attempt to use specially formulated ink that would ofter more resilience to fading due to sunlight. The depth of the pigment injections also matters for the long term quality of the color. Dark brown or black
pigment can turn into a bluish or greenish shade over time. fiis has to do with how deeply the particles are embedded with the skin’s layers, rather than how the ink is made..
 
*TRICOPIGMENTATION FOR THE MOST IDEAL SCALP PIGMENTATION RESULTS*
 
Micropigment is injected very superficially for most natural eftect and the ink used is typically temporary, fading in about 12 years. Individuals who chose Trichopigmentation do not have to worry about facing possible embarrassment resulting
from color changes that occur on their scalp. Some fading may occur. But touch up procedures can help maintain the desired color saturation. The superficial injections of Trichopigmentation ensure that brown will remain brown and black will continue to remain a true blackTrichopigmentation can compliment a transplant surgery in both male and female patients.

*Laser Hair Removal Facts*
Are you tired of shaving, plucking, or waxing? Do you get razor bumps or acne-like breakouts when you get rid of unwanted hair? If so, you may want to consider laser hair removal. Dermatologists use lasers to remove unwanted facial and body hair safely and eftectively. fianks to advances in technology, most people can safely have laser hair removal. Removing the unwanted hair oen requires a few offce visits. Most patients need between 2 to 6 treatments. Afterwards, most patients are free of the unwanted hair for several months. When the hair re-grows, most patients see noticeably less hair than before. The hair also tends to be finer and lighter in color. Laser hair removal can be repeated when the hair regrows.
The lasers designed for hair removal can be used on most parts of the body. Many lasers eftectively treat large areas in a short time. Full body laser with our rapid machines can usually be done in one hour. Laser hair removal can treat the:
- Back.
- Bikini/buttock area.
- Chest
- Face, especially the upper lip and chin.
- Neck
- Shoulders
